List prices before tax. AI usage on Colliedesk depends on ticket volume and the model you pick; with your own key it is billed by your provider.

## Leaving: what Freshdesk gives you

- The ticket export in the Freshdesk UI gives **ticket fields only**, as CSV or Excel. It does not include the conversation, and archived tickets are excluded.
- The API lists **100 tickets per page, up to 300 pages** (30,000 tickets) per filter, and only the **last 30 days** unless you pass \`updated_since\`.
- Closed tickets with no activity for 120 days are **archived** and fetched through a separate endpoint.
- API rate limits are **100, 400 or 700 calls per minute** on Growth, Pro and Enterprise.

Colliedesk keeps your data in PostgreSQL with an open, documented model. ${c.export} The step-by-step guide: [migrate from Freshdesk](/migrate/freshdesk).
