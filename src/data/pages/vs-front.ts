const body = `## The short answer

- **Choose Front** if your team lives in email across many shared and personal inboxes, wants a Gmail-like workspace with comments on every thread, and needs many channels today. It is a mature product.
- **Choose Colliedesk** if you want a shared inbox whose price does not grow with every seat, and data you can export or self-host without asking anyone. Colliedesk is alpha; read the status table first.

## Price, side by side

Front prices below are from the Front pricing page, per seat per month billed annually, read on ${PRICES_READ}. The page does not list monthly-billing prices.

| | Front | Colliedesk |
|---|---|---|
| Plans | Starter $25 (up to 10 seats), Professional $65 (up to 50 seats), Enterprise $105 | ${c.price} |
| AI drafting | Copilot $20 per seat per month on Starter and Professional; included on Enterprise | ${c.ai} |
| AI agent | Autopilot from $0.05 per conversation | Auto-answer with a human in the loop, same AI pricing (coming after beta) |
| Free option | No free plan; 14-day trial | ${c.free} |
| Source code | Proprietary | ${c.source} |

### What five agents pay

| Team | Front Professional + Copilot (annual) | Colliedesk Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| 5 agents | 5 × ($65 + $20) = **$425 per month** | $49 per month + AI usage |

## Leaving: what Front gives you

- There is **no self-serve export** of conversations. A company admin asks Front Support for an account data export.
- The export covers **shared inboxes**: conversations, messages, discussions, comments, and attachments as EML.
- It **leaves out** individual inboxes, contact data, message templates and tags.
- Front acknowledges the request within **72 hours**, then sends the files when they are ready.
