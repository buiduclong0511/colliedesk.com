const body = `## The short answer

- **Choose Helply** (formerly Groove) if you want AI agents to answer most tickets and you are happy to pay by AI usage.
- **Choose Colliedesk** if you want a classic shared inbox and helpdesk with a flat price, where AI drafts (coming after beta) and a human decides, and your data in an open database. Colliedesk is alpha; read the status table first.

## Price, side by side

Read on ${PRICES_READ}.

| | Helply (formerly Groove) | Colliedesk |
|---|---|---|
| Plans | From $49 per month for a block of credits (500 to 32,000); no per-user fees; 15% off annual | ${c.price} |
| AI | Charged in credits: 1 for a draft or summary, 4 or 12 for harder actions; unused credits roll over | ${c.ai} |
| Free option | 14-day trial with 1,000 credits, no card | ${c.free} |
| Source code | Proprietary | ${c.source} |

Both start at $49. The difference: Helply's $49 is a credit budget for AI work, Colliedesk's $49 is the helpdesk for up to 10 agents, with AI billed at model cost +30% or on your own key.

## Leaving: what Groove gives you

- The account owner and admins can download **all conversation data**.
- The export is **JSON only**; Groove says a CSV export is not available.
- **One export at a time**; large exports can take **up to 72 hours**.
