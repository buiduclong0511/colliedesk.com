const body = `> **Status:** the Freshdesk importer is built and in testing. Done-for-you migrations start with **v0.2**. Book now to plan around your renewal date.

## What we move

Tickets (archived ones included), replies, private notes, attachments, tags, contacts, companies and time entries, into one Colliedesk workspace. The data model and the command are public: [import guide](/docs/import-freshdesk).

## How it works

1. You create a Freshdesk API key from your Freshdesk profile and send it to us.
2. We run a first full import into your Colliedesk Cloud workspace.
3. You get the **reconcile report**: Freshdesk count vs Colliedesk count for each kind of record, and a SHA-256 checksum for every attachment.
4. You check your own tickets in Colliedesk while Freshdesk keeps running.
5. On switch day we run a catch-up import of everything that changed since step 2, and you point your support address at Colliedesk.
6. You close Freshdesk only when the final report matches. Then revoke the API key.

## What it costs

| You are | Migration price |
|---|---|
| A founding customer ($100 per workspace per year, locked for life) | **Included.** Done-for-you migration is a founding benefit and is not sold separately. |
| Self-hosting | Free: run the same importer yourself with the [import guide](/docs/import-freshdesk) |

When founding places close, the done-for-you offer closes with them.

${foundingOpen ? `[Become a founding customer, $100/year](${FOUNDING_CHECKOUT})` : `**Founding is closed: all ${FOUNDING_SLOTS} places are taken.** New teams can run the importer themselves with the [import guide](/docs/import-freshdesk).`}

## What we need from you

- A Freshdesk API key from an admin profile. We use it only for the import; revoke it after the final report.
- Your renewal date, so the switch lands before it.
- One person on your team who checks a sample of tickets after the first import.

If you prefer to do it yourself, the step-by-step guide is [migrate from Freshdesk](/migrate/freshdesk).`;
