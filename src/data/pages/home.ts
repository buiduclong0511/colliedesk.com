    a: 'Colliedesk is an open-source (AGPL-3.0) helpdesk for small support teams, made by HC Labs. It is the open-source alternative to Freshdesk, Zendesk and Help Scout: a shared inbox for your team, AI included at cost, one flat price per workspace.',

  {
    q: 'Is Colliedesk free?',
    a: 'Self-hosting is free, forever, with every feature. Colliedesk Cloud costs $49 per workspace per month or $490 per year, with no per-agent fees. See [pricing](/pricing).',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is Colliedesk ready to use?',
    a: 'It is alpha (0.0.x): released and running on Colliedesk Cloud, with a 14-day free trial. The email channel (inbound and outbound, threading), the Freshdesk importer with its reconcile report, saved replies, Cc on replies, attachments and live updates work today. Alpha means the interface or database schema may change between releases. Starting a new conversation from the inbox and contact history are not there yet (beta), and neither is AI.

Over the cap, customer email keeps arriving with its attachments; only your own uploads and new imports pause until you free space or move up. Nothing is deleted. See [pricing](/pricing).`,

    q: 'Who is behind Colliedesk?',
    a: `HC Labs Co., Ltd., a small software company in Hanoi, Vietnam. We build Colliedesk in the open under AGPL-3.0, and we run our own customer support on Colliedesk Cloud. Write to ${CONTACT_EMAIL} and the people who build it answer.`,

    q: 'How does AI pricing work?',

    q: 'Can I move my Freshdesk tickets to Colliedesk?',
