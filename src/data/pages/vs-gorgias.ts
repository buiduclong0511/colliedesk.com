const body = `## The short answer

- **Choose Gorgias** if you run an e-commerce store and want store and order data next to every ticket, with order management automation. That is what it is built for.
- **Choose Colliedesk** if your ticket volume is growing and you do not want the bill to grow with it, or you are not an e-commerce team. Colliedesk is alpha; read the status table first.
