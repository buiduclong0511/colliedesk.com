    q: 'What is the best open-source Freshdesk alternative?',
    a: 'It depends on your channels and timing. Zammad is the most mature open-source helpdesk and its Freshdesk migrator is released today. Chatwoot fits teams whose support is mostly chat and messaging. FreeScout is a light PHP helpdesk with paid modules. Colliedesk is built for small email-support teams leaving Freshdesk, at a flat $49 per workspace, with an importer and reconcile report available now, in alpha.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why are teams leaving Freshdesk?',
    a: `Mostly price. Between December 2025 and January 2026 Freshdesk raised Growth from $15 to $19 and Pro from $49 to $55 per agent per month (billed annually), and Freddy AI Copilot is another $29 per agent. See [Freshdesk price history](/freshdesk-pricing-history).`,

  {
    q: 'Which Freshdesk alternative is cheapest for 5 agents?',
    a: `Among the paid plans we compared on ${PRICES_READ}, Colliedesk Cloud at $490 a year per workspace ($40.83 a month, or $49 billed monthly) is the lowest helpdesk price for 5 agents. Helply (formerly Groove) starts at $49, but that buys AI credits. Zoho Desk Express (€7 per user, max 5) and the free plans of Zoho Desk and HubSpot are cheaper if you can live with their limits.`,

## How to choose

1. **Count your agents.** One or two agents: per-agent plans are often cheaper than any flat price. Three to ten: a flat price wins.
2. **Name your channels.** Mostly email: a ticket helpdesk. Mostly chat and messaging apps: an omnichannel inbox such as Chatwoot.
3. **Decide where the data lives.** If it must stay on your servers, pick an open-source helpdesk you can self-host: Colliedesk, Zammad, FreeScout or Chatwoot.
4. **Price the AI.** Per-seat AI add-ons and per-resolution fees can cost more than the helpdesk. Ask for the price at your ticket volume.
5. **Plan the move before your renewal.** The Freshdesk CSV export has ticket fields only, not the conversation. Read [how to export tickets from Freshdesk](/migrate/freshdesk/export), and insist on proof that every ticket and attachment arrived.

## Where Colliedesk fits

Colliedesk is for **small support teams (3 to 10 agents) leaving Freshdesk**, mostly on email, who want a flat price, AI at model cost and their data in an open database. It is alpha: released and running on Colliedesk Cloud, with the email channel, Cc on replies and the Freshdesk importer. Starting a new conversation from the inbox, contact history and AI are not there yet, and the interface may change. If you need those this week, pick a mature option above. If your renewal is months away, [we migrate you for free](/migrate/freshdesk/done-for-you) on the founding plan.`;
