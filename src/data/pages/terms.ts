const body = `## The short version

- Colliedesk is open source. These terms cover **Colliedesk Cloud**, the version we run for you. Self-hosting follows the [AGPL-3.0 license](/open-source) only.
- Every workspace starts with a 14-day free trial, no card (30 days if you import from Freshdesk). One trial per person and company.
- When the trial or subscription ends, the workspace locks. You can still export everything.
- Your data stays yours. You can export it and leave at any time.
- Do not use Colliedesk to send spam or to break the law.
- Colliedesk is pre-alpha software. We work hard to keep it running and backed up, but we cannot promise it never fails.

## Who you agree with

These terms are an agreement between you and **HC Labs Co., Ltd.** (CÔNG TY TNHH HC LABS), Hanoi, Vietnam ("we"). If you create a workspace for a company, you agree for that company and confirm that you may do so.

## Your account and workspace

- Give a real email address that you control. Sign-in codes go there.
- The workspace admins decide who joins, and are responsible for what their agents do in the workspace.
- Keep access to your email account secure. Anyone who can read it can sign in as you.

## Free trial

- A new workspace gets a 14-day trial of the Team plan with every feature. It extends to 30 days if you import from Freshdesk during the trial.
- One trial per person and company. Creating extra accounts to get more trials is not allowed. See the [privacy policy](/privacy) for how we check this.
- During the trial, Colliedesk sends replies only to customers who wrote to the workspace first, up to 200 replies in 24 hours, and stores up to 2 GB of attachments. These limits stop spammers; a paid plan removes them.
- When the trial ends without a plan, the workspace is locked. You can sign in, export all your data and choose a plan. Choosing a plan unlocks it at once with nothing lost.

## Plans and payment

- Prices are on the [pricing page](/pricing). Payment is handled by Polar, our merchant of record, which also charges the applicable tax.
- Plans are paid in advance, monthly or yearly, and renew automatically until you cancel.
- You can cancel at any time. The plan stays active until the end of the period you paid for, then the workspace locks.
- A price change applies from your next renewal, never to a period you already paid for, and we email workspace admins before it applies. The Founding price stays locked for as long as you keep the subscription.

## Your content

Everything you and your customers put into your workspace stays yours. You give us permission to store, process and display it only to run Colliedesk for you. We do not use it for anything else (see the [privacy policy](/privacy)).

You are responsible for having the right to put that content into Colliedesk, including your customers' personal data.

## Acceptable use

Do not use Colliedesk Cloud to:

- send spam or messages people did not ask for,
- send or store anything illegal, or anything that infringes other people's rights,
- attack, overload or probe the service or other workspaces,
- get around plan limits, trial rules or security controls.

## Suspension and ending

- You can stop using Colliedesk at any time and export your data first.
- We may suspend a workspace that breaks these terms or puts the service or other customers at risk. Where we can, we tell the admins first and give them a chance to fix the problem.
- A workspace that stays locked for 12 months is deleted. We email the admins 30 days before.

## Availability

Colliedesk is pre-alpha (version 0.1). We back up every workspace daily and monitor the service around the clock, but we do not offer an uptime guarantee yet. Features change; we write each change in the [changelog](/changelog).

## Warranty and liability

Colliedesk Cloud is provided "as is", without warranties beyond those the law requires.

To the extent the law allows, our total liability for any claim about Colliedesk Cloud is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months before the claim. We are not liable for indirect losses, such as lost profits or lost business. Nothing in these terms limits liability that cannot be limited by law.

## Law

These terms are governed by the laws of Singapore. If we disagree, we will first try to settle it by email in good faith. If that fails, the courts of Singapore decide.

## Changes to these terms

When we change these terms, we update the date at the top of this page and note it in the [changelog](/changelog). For changes that affect your rights, we email workspace admins before they apply.
