    q: 'Is Zoho Desk cheaper than Colliedesk?',
    a: `For very small teams, yes. Zoho Desk has a free plan for 3 users and Express from €7 per user per month (up to 5 users). From 4 agents on Standard (€14 per user, billed annually, read on ${PRICES_READ}), the per-user bill passes Colliedesk's flat $49 per workspace.`,

  {
    q: 'Which Zoho Desk plan has Zia AI?',
    a: 'Zoho\'s pricing page lists Zia on Professional and Enterprise. Express uses AI agents with your own model key or Zoho\'s LLM.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I export everything from Zoho Desk?',
    a: 'Zoho Desk backups are a ZIP of CSV files per module, up to 10 million records, created and downloaded only by the primary contact. Attachments are not in the file: it holds secure download links, so you fetch the files separately. The backup file is available for 7 days.',
  },
];

const body = `## The short answer

- **Choose Zoho Desk** if you already run Zoho CRM or Zoho One, or you have one to three agents and the free plan is enough.
- **Choose Colliedesk** if you have 4 to 10 agents, want AI without moving up a plan tier, and want your data in an open database you can self-host. Colliedesk is alpha; read the status table first.
