const body = `There are three ways to get your tickets out of Freshdesk. They do not give you the same data.

| What you get | Ticket list export (CSV/Excel) | Account export (XML) | Freshdesk API |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ticket fields (subject, status, priority, dates) | Yes, fields you choose | Yes | Yes |
| Replies and private notes | No | Yes | Yes, extra call per ticket |
| Archived tickets | No | Yes | Separate endpoint |
| Attachments | No | Temporary download links | Temporary download links |
| Contacts and companies | No | Yes | Yes |
| Who can run it | Admin or Supervisor | Account admin | API key with access to the tickets |
| Good for | A spreadsheet or a report | A full backup | A migration you can check |

## 1. Ticket list export: fields only

Use this when you need a spreadsheet, not a backup.

1. Open **Tickets** and select the **All tickets** view.
2. On the list page, set **Created time** to **Any time**.
3. Select **Export** in the top-right corner.
4. Choose CSV or Excel, and the date range.
5. Select the ticket fields. To include Description, expand **Show multiline text fields**.
6. Download the file from **Admin > Account exports** when it is ready.

The export covers only tickets inside the list page's time frame, so set the list to **Any time** first and pick the range in the export window.

## 2. Account export: the full backup

Use this before you cancel, even if you migrate with a tool.

1. Sign in with an account admin.
2. Go to **Admin > Account > Account Details**.
3. Hover over **Export data**, then select **Export**.
4. Wait for the email, then download the zip file. It has one XML file per kind of record: tickets with their conversations, contacts, companies and more.
5. Download the attachments from the links in the export **the same day**. The links expire.
6. Open a few tickets in the XML and compare them with Freshdesk before you trust the backup.

XML is a backup format, not something another helpdesk imports directly. To move to a new helpdesk you still need an importer.

## 3. API: the export you can check

The API is the only route that lets a tool count what it read and prove nothing is missing. Plan for these limits, from Freshdesk's API documentation read on ${PRICES_READ}:

- **30-day default.** Listing tickets returns the last 30 days unless you pass \`updated_since\`.
- **30,000-ticket cap.** 100 tickets per page and 300 pages per filter. Walk larger accounts in date windows.
- **Archived tickets** are fetched one by one from a separate endpoint.
- **Conversations.** \`include=conversations\` embeds at most 10. Fetch the rest from \`/api/v2/tickets/{id}/conversations\`.
- **Rate limits** are shared across the account, so an export slows down your agents' integrations.

## Moving to Colliedesk

\`colliedesk import freshdesk\` does the API route for you: tickets with every reply and note, archived tickets, attachments with a SHA-256 checksum, tags, contacts, companies and time entries. It ends with a reconcile report. If one count does not match, the report says **FAILED** and you keep using Freshdesk. It is available now, in alpha; the [import guide](/docs/import-freshdesk) has the command and flags.

Founding customers get the migration done for them, free. The full exit plan is in [Migrate from Freshdesk](/migrate/freshdesk).
