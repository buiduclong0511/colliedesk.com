    q: 'Is FreeScout really free?',
    a: 'The core is free under AGPL-3.0, with unlimited agents, tickets and mailboxes. Features such as the knowledge base, live chat, tags and workflows are paid modules, sold as lifetime licences per instance. There is no official FreeScout cloud; third-party hosts run it for you.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can FreeScout import from Freshdesk?',
    a: 'Not with an official importer. FreeScout points to a third-party paid migration service, and its wiki lists a community "Freshdesk Import" module with the warning that community modules are not guaranteed to be reliable and secure.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I pick FreeScout or Colliedesk?',
    a: 'FreeScout if you want a proven, lightweight PHP helpdesk that runs even on shared hosting, and you are happy to buy modules. Colliedesk if you want every feature in the free code, a hosted option at a flat price, and a Freshdesk importer with a reconcile report (available now).',
  },
];

const body = `## The short answer

- **Choose FreeScout** if you want a mature, self-hosted helpdesk in the style of Help Scout, you already run PHP, and you are fine buying modules for the knowledge base, live chat, tags or workflows.
- **Choose Colliedesk** if you want every feature in the open-source code, an official hosted option at one flat price, and a Freshdesk importer that proves nothing was lost. Colliedesk is alpha; read the status table first.
