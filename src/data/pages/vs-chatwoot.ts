    q: 'Is Chatwoot a Freshdesk alternative?',
    a: 'It can be, if your support is mostly chat and messaging. Chatwoot is an omnichannel inbox: live chat, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, Telegram, email and more. Colliedesk is a ticket helpdesk for teams whose support is mostly email, priced per workspace instead of per agent.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does Chatwoot import attachments from Freshdesk?',
    a: 'No. Chatwoot\'s Freshdesk importer, on paid plans only, brings contacts and conversations as resolved history. Its guide says attachments, agents, groups, SLAs and automations are not imported, and the Freshdesk API limit of 30,000 tickets applies. The Colliedesk importer (coming v0.2) downloads and checksums every attachment.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much is Chatwoot Cloud for 5 agents?',
    a: `On the Chatwoot pricing page read on ${PRICES_READ}: Startups is $19 per agent per month and Business $39. Five agents: $95 or $195 per month. Extra AI credits are $20 per 1,000.`,
  },

const body = `## The short answer

- **Choose Chatwoot** if most of your conversations come through chat and messaging apps and you want them in one inbox today. It is mature and widely used.
- **Choose Colliedesk** if you run email support, you are leaving Freshdesk with years of tickets and attachments, and you want one flat price. Colliedesk is pre-alpha; read the status table first.
