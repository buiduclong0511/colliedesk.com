const body = `## The short answer

- **Choose HubSpot Service Hub** if your sales and marketing already run on HubSpot and you want tickets on the same contact records.
- **Choose Colliedesk** if you need a helpdesk, not a CRM suite, and want one flat price with AI at cost. Colliedesk is pre-alpha; read the status table first.
