const body = `## What a small support team needs

- **One shared inbox** where everyone sees who owns a ticket: assignee, status, priority, tags, private notes.
- **Email in and out** on your own support address.
- **A price you can predict** when you hire the next person.
- **Your history**, moved in from the old tool without losing replies or attachments.
- **AI drafts** that do not cost another seat licence.

## What it costs as you grow

Freshdesk prices are per agent per month, billed annually, read on ${PRICES_READ}.

## How small teams start

1. **Try it:** [start the 14-day Cloud trial](${TRIAL_HREF}), or self-host free.
2. **Plan the move before your renewal:** the [founding offer](${FOUNDING_HREF}) is $100 per workspace per year, locked for life, and we [migrate your Freshdesk data for you](/migrate/freshdesk/done-for-you).
3. **Switch only when the reconcile report matches.**`;
