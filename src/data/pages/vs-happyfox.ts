const body = `## The short answer

- **Choose HappyFox** if you need a mature, established helpdesk today and the per-agent price fits your budget.
- **Choose Colliedesk** if you have 3 to 10 agents and want one flat price with AI included at cost. Colliedesk is pre-alpha; read the status table first.
