    q: 'Is Colliedesk or Zammad better for leaving Freshdesk today?',
    a: 'Zammad, today. Its Freshdesk migrator is released and self-serve. The Colliedesk Freshdesk importer is built and in testing for v0.2. Choose Colliedesk if you can plan your move around v0.2 and want a flat price, AI at model cost and a reconcile report that proves every record arrived.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does hosted Zammad cost?',
    a: `On the Zammad pricing page read on ${PRICES_READ}: Starter €7–9 per agent per month (up to 5 agents), Professional €16–18 (up to 35 agents), Plus €25–27 (unlimited agents), depending on annual or monthly billing. AI features cost €0.03 per AI call.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Are Zammad and Colliedesk both open source?',
    a: 'Yes. Both are licensed AGPL-3.0 and free to self-host. Zammad is a Ruby on Rails application that runs on PostgreSQL, with Elasticsearch strongly recommended. Colliedesk is one server container plus PostgreSQL.',
  },
];

const body = `## The short answer

- **Choose Zammad** if you need a mature open-source helpdesk now: many channels (email, chat, Telegram, Facebook, WhatsApp, SMS, phone), SLAs, a knowledge base, and a released Freshdesk migrator.
- **Choose Colliedesk** if your team is 3 to 10 agents and you want one flat price instead of per-agent fees, AI without a per-call fee on top, and an import that proves nothing was lost. Colliedesk is pre-alpha; read the status table first.

## Price, side by side

Zammad hosted prices are in euros, per agent per month, excluding VAT, as published on ${PRICES_READ}. The lower figure is billed annually.

| | Zammad | Colliedesk |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted plans | Starter €7–9 (max 5 agents), Professional €16–18 (max 35), Plus €25–27 (unlimited) per agent per month | ${c.price} |
| AI | Optional on Professional and Plus, €0.03 per AI call | ${c.ai} |
| Self-host | Free; paid support from €2,999 per year | ${c.free} |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0 | ${c.source} |

### What five agents pay

| Team | Zammad Professional (hosted) | Colliedesk Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| 5 agents | 5 × €16–18 = **€80–90 per month** + €0.03 per AI call | $49 per month + AI usage |
| 10 agents | 10 × €16–18 = **€160–180 per month** + €0.03 per AI call | $49 per month + AI usage |

## Moving from Freshdesk
