Self-hosting is free, forever, with every feature. We sell two things:

1. **Colliedesk Cloud**: we run it for you. $49 per workspace per month or $490 per year, not per agent.
2. **Migration**: we move your Freshdesk history (tickets, replies, attachments, tags) and give you a reconcile report that proves nothing was lost.

## Why teams switch

- **Leave Freshdesk with all your data** (importer available now): tickets, replies, notes, checksummed attachments, tags and contacts, with a reconcile report. [Migration guide](/migrate/freshdesk).
- **AI that answers tickets, included** (coming after beta): drafts, triage and auto-answer with a human in the loop. Model cost +30%, or bring your own key.
- **Flat price**: $49 per workspace per month, no per-agent fees. Self-host for $0.

## The bill for five agents

List prices per year, billed annually, read on ${PRICES_READ}.

${BARS.map((b) => `- ${b.name}: $${b.usd.toLocaleString('en-US')} (${b.math})`).join('\n')}
- Zendesk Suite Professional + Copilot: 5 × (€115 + €50) × 12 = €9,900 ([details](/vs/zendesk))

## The boring parts already work

We are not rebuilding every Freshdesk feature. We build what a team of three to ten uses every day, and we label the rest. HC Labs runs its own support on Colliedesk Cloud.

## Why a collie?

A collie does not own the flock. It brings every sheep back to the pen and the shepherd decides what happens next. Colliedesk's AI sorts, drafts and chases every ticket so none is lost, while a person on your team approves what goes out.

## If you don't like something, fork it

Colliedesk is AGPL-3.0. The code, your data and the export format are yours. [How the license and the business fit together](/open-source).

## Founding offer

$100 per workspace per year, locked for life, with free Freshdesk migration and a reconcile report. Up to 10 agents, no per-agent fees, 20 GB of attachments including imported files. Cloud Team is $49 a month for up to 10 agents and 100 GB; Team 25 is $99 a month for up to 25 agents and 250 GB. AI at model cost +30% or your own key. Colliedesk Cloud is live; every workspace starts with a 14-day free trial.`;
