# colliedesk.com

Static marketing and docs site, built with [Astro](https://astro.build), React and TypeScript.
React renders at build time only: the browser gets HTML, CSS and two small vanilla scripts
(`public/theme.js`, `public/updates.js`) plus PostHog web analytics (`public/analytics.js`:
cookieless until the visitor accepts cookies in the banner of `public/consent.js`, then cookie
and masked session replay; JavaScript errors always; no person profiles, IP discarded; `pnpm check` fails if that changes), no framework runtime.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/colliedesk/colliedesk product   # docs source, gitignored
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm dev         # astro dev on http://localhost:4321, reloads on save
corepack pnpm build       # astro build, writes _site/
corepack pnpm typecheck   # astro check: TypeScript (strictest) for .ts, .tsx and .astro
corepack pnpm check       # links, .md twins, llms.txt, sitemap, JSON-LD, JS budget (100 KB)
corepack pnpm serve       # serves _site/ on http://localhost:4321 with Cloudflare Pages URL rules
```

`dev`, `build` and `typecheck` read the docs from `./product`; set `PRODUCT_DIR=/path/to/checkout`
to use another checkout. `typecheck` works without it.

## Layout

- `src/data/pages/*.ts`: one typed `Page` (`src/lib/page.ts`) per page: title, description, hero,
  Markdown body, FAQ, JSON-LD. `src/data/pages/index.ts` lists them in llms.txt and sitemap order.
- `src/components/*.tsx`: React components for the header, footer parts, hero, pricing plans and the
  home page sections. `.astro` files render them to static HTML with `html(Component, props)` from
  `src/lib/render-react.ts` (`react-dom/server`), inside `<Fragment set:html={...} />`; there is no
  React integration. Markdown (bodies, FAQ answers) is rendered with `marked` in
  `src/lib/markdown.ts` and placed by the Astro components (`Prose.astro`, `Faq.astro`). The
  release-notes form is plain HTML in `UpdatesForm.astro`, posted by `public/updates.js`.
- `src/layouts/Base.astro`: the HTML document (head, canonical, Markdown alternate, JSON-LD, fonts).
- `src/pages/`: Astro routes. `[...slug].astro` builds every HTML page; `[...slug].md.ts` builds its
  Markdown twin (`/pricing` and `/pricing.md`); `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `sitemap.xml`,
  `robots.txt` and `changelog.xml` are static endpoints; `404.astro` is the not-found page.
  `_headers` is written after the build by `src/integrations/cloudflare-headers.ts`.
- `public/`: files served as they are (fonts, icons, images, CSS, the two scripts).
- `src/integrations/no-bundled-client-js.ts` fails the build if any script other than
  `theme.js`, `updates.js`, `analytics.js` and JSON-LD would ship (a bundled or inlined `<script>`). A `client:*`
  directive on a React component fails earlier: without a React renderer Astro cannot hydrate it.

## Content

- `/docs` and `/roadmap` render `docs/user/*.md` and `ROADMAP.md` from [colliedesk/colliedesk](https://github.com/colliedesk/colliedesk). Edit those files there, not here. Every 15 minutes CI compares those docs on `main` with `/product-docs-version.txt` on the live site (`scripts/product-docs-version.sh`) and rebuilds when they differ. To preview unmerged docs, run the Site workflow with `product_ref` set to a branch of colliedesk/colliedesk: it builds, checks and uploads the site as an artifact without deploying. Pull requests there that touch the docs build this site too, so a broken link fails before merge.
- Shared facts (prices, positioning, repo URL) are in `src/lib/site.ts`. Competitor prices carry their source and read date on each `/vs` page.
- Mark unshipped features with `**Coming v0.N**` in Markdown; the build turns it into a badge.
- Deploy: GitHub Pages from `.github/workflows/site.yml`, custom domain `colliedesk.com`, output directory `_site` (`_headers` keeps the Cloudflare Pages rules for `pnpm serve`).
- Refactors that should not change the output: build `main` and the branch into two directories and
  run `node scripts/compare-site.mjs <main-build> <branch-build>`. Non-HTML files must be
  byte-identical; HTML is compared after the normalisation described at the top of the script.

## Design

References: t3.codes (honest "what are you selling me", fork-it, terminal snippets), plausible.io
("X alternative" positioning, transparent pricing, vs pages), cal.com (pricing answered in the FAQ,
footer comparison links).

Brand: **ink and paper**, shared with the app; the brand guideline is in the app repo,
`docs/internals/design.md` (owner decision 19/10/2026; research on https://design.hclabs.co, owner only).
`public/tokens.css` is a copy of the app's `web/src/styles/tokens.css` (change it there first; the app
repo checks contrast for every pair and fails when a grey, a text token or the primary action has a hue).

- Colour: neutral grey surfaces (`--surface-0` `#fafafa`, cards `#ffffff`), ink text and ink buttons and
  links (`#171717`; dark theme `#0a0a0a` page, `#fafafa` ink). The price has its own colour (`--price`,
  `#c2410c`, dark `#fb8a4a`); status colours appear only inside product pictures. `pnpm check` fails
  when `styles.css` uses the accent token more than its budget.
- Layout (from a full-page teardown of nine helpdesk sites): one page background, no tinted bands; one
  idea per section with a crop of the real product on a soft panel (`--panel`); three checkable facts
  under the hero; a dark closing band. Text sits in plain columns under a hairline; code and tables sit
  on a 1px shadow ring (`--ring`).
- Type: self-hosted IBM Plex Sans and Mono; Instrument Serif for h1 and h2. Sentence case everywhere,
  mono only for code.
- Product pictures: `public/product-inbox.jpg` (and `@2x`) is a screenshot of the app with demo data
  (Northwind Help). Retake it when the app's look changes; `src/components/home/ProductCrop.tsx` holds
  the crop regions.
- Light is the default; the footer **Dark theme** button sets `data-theme="dark"` and saves it in
  `localStorage` for this site only (`public/theme.js`). Spacing is a 4 px grid (`--space-*`); buttons
  are at least 44 px tall on touch (`--touch`).
